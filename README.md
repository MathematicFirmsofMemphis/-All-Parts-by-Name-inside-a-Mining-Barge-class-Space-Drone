# -All-Parts-by-Name-inside-a-Mining-Barge-class-Space-Drone
All the parts in a mining barge space drone by their name in non-fiction or working parts:\


Also added Blackscale-Vision for viewing deep space without the color black which is a shadow. 
Added A System called global axis geo-vision similar to earth's geo-vision from the atmosphere features which allows humans to see geology and geography.
This is a response to simulations that are lit and not dark and contain geography and geology which cannot be seen by camera or eye that is not at a specific geo-

Added gas vision and liquid vision with geo-vision for the mining barge-class space drone. This means you can see gas and liquids along side geography globally anywhere in deep space! 
Test them in a black hole simulation and air flow simulation and more for fracture prevention!
